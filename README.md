Welcome to Aether Framework *a simple and lightweight modding framework*.

The main purpose of this modding framework is to keep it simple to add modding on different type of projects and applications.

The framework itself its pretty modular and it's built on top of that mindset, allowing the developer to be able to change aspects of the framework without having to change a lot from it.
